# react-mobx-router5

> [Router5](http://router5.github.io/) integration with [mobx](https://mobx.js.org/) and [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/).  
> **Working Example**: [react-mobx-router5-example](https://github.com/LeonardoGentile/react-mobx-router5-example) 

## Introduction
This package represents a routing alternative to react-router.  
This is especially useful if you already use [mobx](https://mobx.js.org/) and [mobx-react](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react) in your react project.  

To make this work in your project you should use [router5](https://github.com/router5/router5) as routing library (independent from react) and the [mobx-router5](https://github.com/LeonardoGentile/mobx-router5) plugin 
which exposes the router5's states as mobx _observable_ variables.  

The React Components exported by this package uses [mobx-router5](https://github.com/LeonardoGentile/mobx-router5) as the source of truth. 
They _observe_ the `mobx-router5` _observables_ and react when they change.
 
## Requirements

- __react >= 16.0.0__
- __mobx >= 5.0.0__
- __mobx-react >= 5.2.0__ - In order to be compatible with MobX > 5.0.0
- __router5 >= 6.1.0__  - Version 7 not yet supported
- __mobx-router5 >= 4.3.0__ - In order to be compatible with MobX > 5.0.0

These are considered `peerDependencies` that means they should exist in your installation, you should install them yourself to make this plugin work. 
The package won't install them as dependencies.

Notice __Mobx@5__ introduced breaking changes, please follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/blob/e17c47833d1812eee6d77914be890aa41e4b7908/CHANGELOG.md#500)

## Installation 

```bash
npm install react-mobx-router5
```

## Configuration
In you application entry point you should configure and instantiate a new `router` and a mobx-router5 `routerStore` as 
described in the [mobx-router5 documentation](https://github.com/LeonardoGentile/mobx-router5#how-to-use).

The `routerStore` instance is important as it exposes the router5
state as mobx observables. So the __routerStore__ is indeed the _source of truth_ for our components.
 
After the instantiation of the store we need to pass it to the components using the `mobx-react` [Provider](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react#provider-and-inject) component. 
Internally the components exported by this package will use `@inject` to grab the `routerStore`.  

An example would make this more clear:


```javascript
//stores.js (mobx stores)
import tabStore from './TabStore';
import userStore from './UserStore';
import {RouterStore} from 'mobx-router5';

// Instantiate it directly or extend the class as you wish before invoking new
const routerStore = new RouterStore();

export {
  tabStore,
  userStore,
  routerStore
};
```


```javascript
//create-router5.js
import {createRouter} from 'router5';
import loggerPlugin from 'router5/plugins/logger'; 
import browserPlugin from 'router5/plugins/browser';
import {mobxPlugin} from 'mobx-router5';
import routes from './routes';
import {routerStore} from './stores';

export default function configureRouter(useLoggerPlugin = false) {
  const router = createRouter(routes, {defaultRoute: 'home'})
    .usePlugin(mobxPlugin(routerStore)) // Important: pass the store to the plugin!
    .usePlugin(browserPlugin({useHash: true}));
  
  if (useLoggerPlugin) {
    router.usePlugin(loggerPlugin) ;
  }
  return router;
}
```


```javascript
//app.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {Provider} from 'mobx-react';
import Layout from './components/Layout'
import * as stores from './stores'; //mobx stores
import createRouter from './create-router5';

const router = createRouter(true);

// Provider will add all the mobx stores (including the routerStore) in context.
const wrappedApp = (
  <Provider {...stores } >
    <Layout/>
  </Provider>
);

// Renders the entire app when the router starts
router.start((err, state) => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    wrappedApp,
    document.getElementById('app')
  );
});

```

From now on you can use all the components and HOC exported by this package without further steps. 
The components will always be in sync with the `routerStore` internal observables and react when they will change.

## What does this package export?

**Components for Routing and View Selection**

- [routeNode](#routenode---hoc): **HOC** for wrapping the 'route nodes' of your app
- [getComponent](#getcomponent---helper-function): **Helper function** to select what component to render from routes configuration 
- [RouteView](#routeview---component): **Component** to automatically select and render a component retrieved from the routes configuration 

**Components for Navigation and Routes Injections**

- [withRoute](#withroute---hoc): **HOC** to re-render any component on any route change and inject router's observables 
- [BaseLink](#baselink---component): **Component** to generate simple `a` element not aware of route's change    
- [Link](#link---component): **Component** resulting from `BaseLink` and `withRoute` composed together
- [withLink](#withlink---hoc): **HOC** for creating custom wrappers around a `<BaseLink/>` component
- [NavLink](#navlink---component): **Component** resulting from `li` element and `withLink` composed together
 
    
## Components for Routing and View Selection

### routeNode - HOC

Quoting the [router5 documentation](http://router5.github.io/docs/understanding-router5.html):
> On a route change, you only need to re-render a portion of your app.
  
This is basically what `routeNode` is for: by wrapping a *node component* (a component associated with a route having children routes) we are telling to re-render 
only a portion of our app when there is a specific route change. This is probably the most important component of this package. 


**Signature**  

`routeNode(nodeName, storeName='routerStore')(RouteComponent)`
 
**Params**  

- `nodeName`: the name of route to associate to the component (`''` if root node)
- `storeName` (optional, __default__: `'routerStore'`): the RouterStore name if it differs from the default
- `RouteComponent`: the component to wrap

**Return**  
The `routeNode` function returns another function `routeNodeWrapper(RouteComponent)` that in turn returns a `RouteNode` component: the actual HOC.  
The final usage would be:
  
`const RouteNodeInstance = routeNode(nodeName)(RouteComponent)`; 

The newly created `RouteNodeInstance` HOC is a *wrapper* around `RouteComponent` and will: 

 - forward all the props received to the wrapped `RouteComponent`
 - inject the `route` (observable), `plainRoute` (non-observable) and `routerStore` props to the `RouteComponent`  
 - trigger a re-rendering of itself and of the wrapped `RouteComponent` only **when** the **nodeName** is the correct **intersection node** for the current route transition (see [understanding router5](http://router5.github.io/docs/understanding-router5.html) and the example below).


**Usage**   

Given for example a route name `'users'` associated with a component `UsersComp` having children routes `users.list` and `users.detail` then the route `'users'` should be considered a *route node* for the application.  
Its associated component `UsersComp` should be the one responsible for **selecting and re-rendering** the components associated with its **children** routes. 

`const UsersCompNode = routeNode('users')(UsersComp)`;

 
**Example**

In the following example when navigating from `'users.list'` -> `'users.detail'` then `'users'` is the **intersection node**.  
Wrapping the `UserComp` with `RouteNode` ensures that during this transition the `UserComp` will re-render 
and so it will be able to determine which component to show (associated to one of its sub-routes).  

If then we navigate from `'users.list'` -> `'home'` then the intersection node is `''` (the root node) and so `UsersComp` will not re-render.  
In this case it's the root node responsibility (for example a `Main` component wrapped with `routeNode`) to re-render. 
  
**Note**  
  
The logic on how to select and render the correct sub-component is up to you, in the example it is used a simple switch.  
See the [Rendering Route Views](#rendering-route-views) section below for alternative implementations. 
  
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { routeNode } from 'react-mobx-router5';
import { UserView, UserList, NotFound } from './components';

function UsersComp(props) {
    // These are injected by routeNode HOC
    const { routerStore, route, plainRoute } = props; 

    switch (route.name) {
        case 'users.detail':
            return <UserDetail/>;
        case 'users.view':
            return <UserView/>;
        default:
            return <NotFound/>;
    };
}

export default routeNode('users')(UsersComp); 

```

--------

### Rendering Route Views

At this point only the components wrapped with `routeNode` are associated with some of the app routes, so what about all the other components and routes?
  
> [...] rather than the router updating the view, it is up to the view to listen / bind / subscribe to route changes in order to update itself.   
> [...] The router is unaware of your view and you need to bind your view to your router's state updates.  


In the above example the sub-components of a component wrapped with `routeNode` are selected with a simple switch statement. This is a possible implementation.   
  
In this section I present **two (opinionated) personal implementations**:

 - `getComponent` function helper
 - `RouteView` Component
    
Be warned:  

  - these are not the only ones, you are free to implement your own
  - hot reloading might not work
  - these implementations are optional, you can use this package without them (and use a simple switch for example)


#### Routes configuration
For both solutions to work we need to use the router5' [Nested arrays of routes config](http://router5.github.io/docs/configuring-routes.html) introducing an additional `component` field for associating a component with a route.

**Example**
   

```javascript
//routes.js
import {Home} from './components/Home';
import {Index} from './components/Index';
import {Login} from './components/Login';
import Sections from './components/Nodes/Sections';
import Subsections from './components/Nodes/Subsections';

export default [
  // children of the root routeNode ''
  { name: 'home', path: '/', component: Home}, // Notice the extra `component` field
  { name: 'login', path: '/login', component: Login},
  { name: 'index', path: '/index/:id', component: Index},
  { name: 'section', path: '/section', component: Sections, children: [ 
    // children of 'section' routeNode
    { name: 'home', path: '/home', component: Home },
    { name: 'login', path: '/login', component: Login },
    { name: 'index', path: '/index/:id', component: Index },
    { name: 'subsection', path: '/subsection', component: Subsections, children: [
      // children of 'section.subsection' routeNode
      { name: 'home', path: '/home', component: Home },
      { name: 'login', path: '/login', component: Login },
      { name: 'index', path: '/index/:id', component: Index },
    ]}
  ]}
];

```

Notice that the component associated with a route node (the ones having children, for example `Sections`) should already be wrapped with `routeNode`. In other words the `Sections` component should be exported like this:

```javascript
export default routeNode('section')(Sections);
``` 
  
Also notice that by associating a route with a component might apparently break the router5's principle 
> The router is unaware of your view  

but as I will show this isn't true because the `component` field is not used by the router but by our views!
  
  
### getComponent - Helper function

When using the above routes configuration this helper is used for selecting the correct component to render for a given `route` and a `routeNodeName`. 
This represents an alternative to the switch statement.
   
**Signature**  

`getComponent(route, routeNodeName, routesConfig)` 

**Params**

- `route`: either the `routerStore.route` __object__ or the _route name_ as a **string**. Usually it's the currently active route
- `routeNodeName`: the name of the route associated with the React component from where to re-render (Node Component)
- `routesConfig`: nested routes configuration array (with the extra `component` as shown above)
    
**Return**  
  
It returns a `React.Component`: the component to be rendered extracted from the routes configuration.   
  
**Example**

```javascript
//Main.jsx: the root routeNode ('')
import React, {createElement} from "react";
import {routeNode, getComponent} from "react-mobx-router5";
import routes from "../../routes";

class Main extends React.Component {
  render(){
    // injected by routeNode HOC
    const { routerStore, route, plainRoute } = this.props; 
    
    // This will extract the correct component amongst the children of '' for the current route 
    // Notice that the ComponentToRender could also be another "node component", that is associated with another routeNode, for example `Section`
    const ComponentToRender = getComponent(route, '', routes);
    // Passing the route prop will ensure that the ComponentToRender will be re-rendered for each new route
    return createElement(ComponentToRender, {route: route}); 
  }
}

// higher-order component to wrap a route node component.
export default routeNode('')(Main);
```
  
  
```javascript
//Section.jsx: the `section` routeNode
import React, {createElement} from "react";
import {routeNode, getComponent} from "react-mobx-router5";
import routes from "../../routes";

class Section extends React.Component {
  render(){
    // injected by routeNode HOC
    const { route, routerStore, plainRoute } = this.props; 
    
    // in this case I use the route name (stirng)
    const ComponentToRender = getComponent(route.name, 'section', routes);
    return createElement(ComponentToRender, {route: route}); 
  }
}

export default routeNode('section')(Section);
```


### RouteView - Component

The `getComponent` solution introduces some repetition, that is, you always need to grab the component to render and then render it:

```javascript
const ComponentToRender = getComponent(route, 'section', routes);
return createElement(ComponentToRender, {route: route}); 
```

The `RouteView` component does these two operations for you. 
  
**Props**  
  
All props not listed below will be passed trough to the new generated component additionally forwarding the `route` prop.
  
- `route`: a route object (**required**). It **might** be better to pass the **non-observable** `plainRoute` injected by `routeNode` rather than `routerStore.route` 
  to avoid possible inconsistencies if the subcomponents are observers of `route` (**TODO**: This use case needs more study)  
- `routeNodeName`: the name of the route for the React component from where to re-render (route node)
- `routes`: nested routes configuration array (with the extra `component` field for each route)
- `errorMessage`: a string for custom message to display inside an `h1` in case of error during the component selection. *Optional*, **default: 'Something went wrong.'**
- `errorStyle`: a style object to be applied to the `h1` error description. *Optional*, **default: {color: 'rgb(217, 83, 79)'**

Notice that the RouteView component is internally wrapped with an [Error Boundary Component](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/07/26/error-handling-in-react-16.html)  (introduced in react 16), this ensure that in case of exception while selecting the component to display the entire app won't crash and an error message will be displayed instead. The error message is rendered inside an `h1`, it is customizabile using the `errorMessage` and `errorStyle` props passed to `routeView`.

**Example**  

```javascript
//Main.jsx: the root routeNode ('')
import React, {createElement} from "react";
import {routeNode, RouteView} from "react-mobx-router5";
import routes from "../../routes";

const routeNodeName = '';

class Main extends React.Component {
  render(){
    const {route, routerStore} = this.props;
    return <RouteView 
      route={route} 
      routeNodeName={routeNodeName} 
      routes={routes} 
      // other props
      otherProp='hello' 
      myOtherProp='bye' />;
  }
}

export default routeNode('')(Main);
```

Notice in the above example that the newly generated component will receive these props: `otherProp`, `myOtherProp` and the **extra** `route`.
  


## Components for Navigation and Routes Injections 

### withRoute - HOC

Function that generates an higher-order component to wrap any component that need to re-render on route changes.  

**Signature**  

`withRoute(BaseComponent, storeName='routerStore')`
  
**Params**
  
- `BaseComponent`: the component to be wrapped
- `storeName` (optional, __default__: `routerStore`): the RouterStore name if it differs from the default
 
  
**Return**  
  
It returns a `ComponentWithRoute` that wraps `BaseComponent`.


**Usage** 

`const MyCompWithRoute = withRoute(MyComp);`  
  
Any component wrapped by this HOC:
  
  - receives all the props passed to the wrapper
  - is injected with these extra props coming from **mobx-router5**: `routerStore`, `route`
  - is injected with these *computed* extra props: `isActive` and `className` (see below)
  - re-renders on any route change


**Injected computed props** (`isActive` and `className`)

Some special props passed to the wrapper are used to compute other extra props that will be injected in the wrapped component.

The following props are used to compute a **new prop** `isActive` (bool) injected into the wrapped `BaseComponent`:    

  - `routeName` (string): name of the route that should be associated with the `BaseComponent`
  - `routeParams` (obj) **default** `{}`: the route params  
  - `activeStrict` (bool) **default** `false`: whether to check if `routeName` is the active route, or part of the active route

  
Also if a `routeName` prop is passed then an `activeClassName` (default 'active') will be added to the `className` when the component is `isActive` and the **newly computed prop** `className` (string) is injected into the wrapped `BaseComponent`:

  - `className` (string) **default** `''`: prop forwarded 
  - `activeClassName` (string) **default** `'active'`: the name of the class to apply when the element is active

**Example**

In the following example the MyComp used within Container will re-render on any route change.   
  
When the current route is `home`:
  
- a className `'hello hyperactive'` will be applied
- the prop `isActive` will be `true` 
  
  
```javascript
// MyComp.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { withRoute } from 'react-mobx-router5';

function MyComp(props) {
  // these are injected by withRoute
  const { route, isActive, className } = props;
  
  return (
    <div className={className}>
      I am {isActive: 'active' ? 'inactive' } <br/>
      The current route is {route}
    </div>
  )	

}
export default withRoute(MyComp);
```

```javascript
// Container.jsx
import React from 'react';
import MyComp from './MyComp';

function Container(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComp
        routeName='home'
        className='hello'
        activeClassName='hyperactive' />
    </div>
  )	

}
export default Container;
```
 
--------
  
### BaseLink - Component
 
It generates an anchor `a` tag with `href` computed from `props.routeName`.  
**Note:** This component *won't re-render* on route change.

**Props**
  
In order to work it is **mandatory** to pass at least one of these props to the component:

  - `router={routerInstance}` the router5 instance object. 
  - `routerStore={routerStore}` the *mobx-router5* `routerStore`. If passed will take precedence over `router` prop
  - `onClick={onClickCB}` when passed the navigation will be prevented (the above 2 props become both unnecessary) and the `onClickCB` function will be executed instead.  

Props needed to compute the correct `href` (when passing either `router` or `routerStore`):

  - `routeName="home"` route to navigate to when the component is clicked
  - `routeParams={routeParamsObj}` *optional*, **default {}**
  - `routeOptions={routeOptionsObj}` *optional*, **default {}**

**Example**  
  

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { BaseLink } from 'react-mobx-router5';

function logMeIn(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  console.log('clicked');
}

function Menu(props) {
  return (
    <nav>
      <BaseLink routerStore={props.routerStore} routeName='home' routeOptions={{reload: true}}>Home</BaseLink>
      <BaseLink router={props.router} routeName='home'>About</BaseLink>
      <BaseLink onClick={logMeIn} >Login</BaseLink>
    </nav>
  );
}

export default Menu;
```
   
--------    
 
### Link - Component

The `Link` component is `BaseLink` and `withRoute` **composed together**.  
This means that `Link` will re-render on any route change and an 'active' class will be applied to it when 
the current route is `props.routeName`.
  
--------
  
### withLink - HOC

Function that generates a higher-order component to create custom wrappers around a `<BaseLink/>` component.  
Useful for creating any sort of wrappers that will be **aware of route changes**, for example for creating navigation menus.  

**Signature**  

`withLink(LinkWrapper, storeName='routerStore')` 
  
**Params**

- `LinkWrapper`: the component used to wrap the inner `BaseLink`
- `storeName` (optional, __default__: `routerStore`): the RouterStore name if it differs from the default
  
  
**Return**  

The function creates a new `WithLink` higher-order component that wraps the passed `LinkWrapper`.  
The `LinkWrapper` is in turn a wrapper around the `BaseLink`.   
This composed element is then passed to `withRoute(WithLink)`.   
The final returned component would then be a `ComponentWithRoute`

**Props**
  
The final composed component accepts all the props accepted by the `WithRoute` component with an extra special  
`linkClassName` prop.
  
All props passed to the composed component (including the one injected by `withRoute`) will be forwarded to the inner `BaseLink` except for `className`.   
In fact the (computed 'active') `className` will be applied to the `LinkWrapper` while the extra `linkClassName`  (unmodified) will be applied to the inner `BaseLink`.  

Also all the `children` of the final composed component will become children of the inner `BaseLink`. 
  
    
**Example**   
  
```javascript
const MyLinkWrapper = withLink('div');
```     

 - This produces a `div` that wraps a `BaseLink` component. Then this result is passed to `withRoute`.  
 - The `'active'` className will be applied to the `div` not the on `BaseLink` (so not on the generated `a`).  
 - If we pass an `linkClassName` then it will become the `className` of the inner `BaseLink` (so of the generated `a`)

See the `NavLink` component.

--------
  
### NavLink - Component

The `NavLink` component is the `li` element and `withLink` composed together.

```javascript
const NavLink = withLink('li');
```

__Example__:

```javascript
import {NavLink} from 'react-mobx-router5'

function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <NavLink 
      className="hello" 
      linkClassName="goodbye"
      routeName="home">
      HOME
    </NavLink>
  )
}

```

Will produce something like this (pseudo-code):

```html
<li className={props.className} >
  <BaseLink { ...props } className={props.linkClassName} >
    {props.children}
  </BaseLink>
</li>

```
That is indeed very similar to what `Link` looks like, except this will apply the 'active' className to the `li` and the 
`linkClassName` to the internal `BaseLink` (and so to the generated an `a` tag)

## Production Build
As recommended by [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#webpack) and 
[MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#new-features) make sure to substitute 
`process.env.NODE_ENV = "production"` in your build process.
 
### Remove PropTypes
The components are shipped with [prop-types](https://github.com/reactjs/prop-types) checks (`prop-types` is dependencies of this package).  
If you want to remove them from your build you could use [babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types). 

You could for example add this to your babel config:

```
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "plugins": [
        "transform-react-remove-prop-types", {
          "mode": "wrap"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
or 

```
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "plugins": [
        ["transform-react-remove-prop-types", {
          "mode": "remove",
          "removeImport": true
          "ignoreFilenames": ["node_modules"]
        }]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Check the [doc](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types#mode) of the plugin for choosing the correct configuration.
